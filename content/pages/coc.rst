[Insert medium public version of policy here.]
==============================================

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments [related to gender, gender identity and expression,
sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, [your specific
concern here]], sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following,
harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate
physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior
are expected to comply immediately.

[Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar activities are also subject to
the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities,
or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized
clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.]

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they
deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference [with no refund].
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns,
please contact a member of conference staff immediately. [Conference staff can be identified by
t-shirts/special badges/head sets.]

Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law
enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the
duration of the conference. We value your attendance.
